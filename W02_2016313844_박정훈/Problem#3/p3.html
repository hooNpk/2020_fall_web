    <p>MC 2016, a workshop on Mobile Communications 2016, will be held on July 04 - 07, 2016, at the Park Plaza Beijing Science Park Hotel, Beijing, China, in collaboration with the with the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and is the next event in a series of highly successful international workshops on Mobile Communications (MC), previously held as MC 2015 (Banff, Canada), MC 2014 (Guimaraes, Portugal), MC 2013 (Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam), MC 2012 (Salvador, Brazil), MC 2011 (Santander, Spain), MC 2010 (Fukuoka, Japan), MC 2009 (Suwon, Korea), MC 2008 (Perugia, Italy), MobiComm 2007 (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), MC 2006 (Glasgow, UK), MobiComm 2005 (Singapore), Workshop of Routing and Handoff 2004 (Assisi, Italy), Mobile Computing: Routing and Handoff 2003 (Montreal, Canada), and Mobile Computing: Authentication Technology 2003 (Montreal, Canada).</p>
    <p>MC 2016 provides a premier forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of mobile communications.
    <br>The next generation mobile communications are expected to carry Human Computer Interaction (HCI) related services and applications in Ubiquitous lives. Effective communication mechanisms for HCI software, hardware, and middleware platforms are important. This is an important application area to Computational Science as it requires mathematical modeling and simulation systems. The goal of this workshop is to share research and development experiences and ideas among people in this field.</p>

    <br>

    <br>
    To submit a paper, please refer to instructions available on the <a href="...">ICCSA 2016 web site.</a> Only papers submitted through the electronic submission and strictly adhering to the relevant format will be considered for reviewing and publication.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style="color:red">*** Important Notes:</span></b> When you upload your paper, the name of session must be “Mobile Communications 2016 (MC 2016)”.<br>
    <br>
    The paper must present an original and unpublished work, not submitted for publication elsewhere (copyright problems fall entirely under responsibility of the authors). Each paper will be reviewed by at least three experts in the relevant field (acceptance rate was 26% in 2015) ensuring the acceptance only to top quality contributions.<br>
    <br>
    When a paper is accepted at least one of the authors has to register to the conference and deliver the related talk. Failure to do so shall lead to rejection of the application to attend next year conference and the exclusion of the paper for the current year proceedings.</p>
